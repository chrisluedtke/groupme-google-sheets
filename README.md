# GroupMe Export

This script retrieves all GroupMe data from a single group chat for further analysis.

You'll need these environment variables:
* `GROUPME_TOKEN`: found on [GroupMe's developers website](https://dev.groupme.com/session/new), click "Access Token" (upper right)
* `GROUPME_GROUP_NAME`: the name of the group of interest, case insensitive
